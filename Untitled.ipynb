      "ðŸ”¹ Question: What is machine learning?\n",
      "ðŸ”¹ Answer: Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms use data to find patterns and make predictions or decisions. It can be categorized into two main types: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, machine learning has become an essential technology in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and technology.\n"
